# Application Studio Toolkit

## Description

The **SAP Business Application Studio toolkit** allows you to remotely control dev spaces that are hosted in SAP Business Application Studio.

From Visual Studio Code, you open a desktop client that allows you to work on a dev space as if you were in SAP Business Application Studio.

You can run commands and enjoy great productivity tools such as storyboard, service center, run configurations, task manager, and many more. All you need to do, is install the extension and connect to your landscape — no special knowledge or software required.

This is the recommended development experience while working locally.

### Connect your Visual Studio Code to SAP Business Application Studio

1. In the SAP Business Application Studio Desktop view, click `+`.

2. Enter your landscape URL.

3. Select your landscape and log in.

4. Once you are connected, your dev spaces are displayed and you can manage them from VS Code.

Any change made in VS Code is mirrored in SAP Business Application Studio and vice-versa.

5. Once a dev space is started, you can open it in a new window.<br>**_Note_**: _We support only one open dev space at a time_.
